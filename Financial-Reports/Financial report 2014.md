## OBF under financial sponsorship

As of April 1, 2013, OBF does not maintain its own bank accounts anymore. All of OBF's financial assets have been transferred to, and are now managed by Software in the Public Interest ([SPI]), a fiscal sponsorship organization for open-source projects with which OBF became an associated project in October 2012.

## Income

| Item                                        |Date(s)|   Amount  |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|----------:|
| Sponsorship of 2014 BOSC                    | 3/26  |    $  500 |
| Sponsorship of 2014 BOSC (./. $18 wire fee) | 3/31  |    $  982 |

| Sponsorship of 2014 BOSC                    | 9/27  |    $1,000 |

Sponsorships were from Harbinger Partners, GigaScience, Google, and
Curoverse. Another sponsorship commitment, from Eagle Genomics, was
received in cash only in Jan 2015, and is hence not accounted for in
FY 2014.

The Google Summer of Code Mentoring Organization payment for OBF's
2014 GSoC participation ($3,000 mentor stipends, plus 791.99 GSoC
summit travel reimbursement) was only received in Feb 2015, and hence
is not accounted for in FY 2014.

Total income: $7,482

## Expenses

| Item                                        |Date(s)|   Amount  |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|----------:|
| Amazon Hosting Dec 2012-Nov 2013            | 1/2   | $2,214.65 |
| Biomoby.org renewal (incurred 9/29/2013)    | 1/2   |    $10.00 |
| BioR.org renewal (incurred 11/3/2013)       | 1/2   |    $10.00 |
| BioPerl.org renewal                         | 1/2   |    $10.00 |
| Biocpp.{org,net,com} renewal                | 3/9   |    $34.51 |

| SPI 5% fees                                 |       |   $ 49.94 |

The actual renewal cost for Biosoap.org was $10.48, but the
reimbursement request erroneously only asked for $10.00. The
difference of $0.48 is considered forfeited by the reimbursed Board
member (Lapp).

Totals for FY 2014:
+ Total programmatic expenses paid:            $2,289.16
+ Total expenses:                              $2,339.10

## Encumbrances

Encumbrances are unpaid liabilities and other financial commitments already incurred, but not yet paid. This includes expenses paid by, but not yet reimbursed to Board members and other persons authorized to make payments on behalf of the OBF.
